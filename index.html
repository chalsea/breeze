        <h2>Breeze is designed as a platform to showcase your business.</h2>

<p>It provides intuitive front-end editing, and a clean separation of content strategy from visual design, so you can update your site with confidence. Breeze is built on industry-standard open-source components, so you're never locked in to a single supplier. When you're ready to to extend beyond a brochure, Breeze can extend to support eCommerce, blogging and custom application development.</p>

<h3>Intuitive front-end editing</h3>

<p>Breeze lets you see your pages as you add content. You can drag blocks of content to new positions, and modify content separately from presentation. It requires minimal learning to get started on the real work of communicating with customers.</p>

<h3>Content strategy</h3>

<p>Breeze provides structured content types that help you maintain consistency and plan what will appear on the site before you create it. This allows designers to work with confidence, with a common understanding of the site's purpose. There's built-in support for SEO features such as meta tags, redirects, and simple human-readable URLs. Breeze also helps you manage images, PDFs and other assets used on your site.</p>

<h3>Design freedom</h3>

<p>Breeze makes it easy to convert a static HTML design into a reusable layout with regions for placing content and dynamic elements. It uses real Ruby code instead of a proprietary template language, so there's no limit to what you can add to a page. You can make rapid adjustments to a live site with the built-in theme editor, or build offline and update your completed theme when it's ready.
Breeze doesn't say no to designers.</p>

<h3>Solid foundations, open for extension</h3>

<p>Breeze is open source, and built with the industry-standard Ruby on Rails 3 platform. We've designed it throughout to make sure you retain ownership of all aspects of your site, and won't be locked in to a single supplier.
Modules are available for eCommerce and blogging, and developers can extend Breeze with custom components to fit your particular business needs.</p>
